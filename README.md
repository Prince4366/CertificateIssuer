# Blockchain-Based Certificate Issuance System

## 🧾 Project Description
This smart contract allows a central authority (e.g., a university or certification agency) to issue tamper-proof certificates to students on the blockchain. Each certificate is tied to a student’s wallet address and includes details like the student’s name, course name, and issue date.

## 🔭 Project Vision
Our goal is to enable a decentralized, immutable, and transparent system for academic or professional certification that eliminates the possibility of forgery and simplifies verification for employers, institutions, or government bodies.

## ✨ Key Features
- Issuers can issue certificates to student wallets.
- Anyone can verify the authenticity and status of a certificate.
- Issuers can revoke certificates if needed.
- All records are immutable and verifiable on-chain.

## 🌱 Future Scope
- Integrate with IPFS or Filecoin to attach PDF versions of the certificate.
- Build a front-end interface to let students view and share certificates.
- Enable multi-signer verification for institutions.
- Add expiration or recertification logic.
